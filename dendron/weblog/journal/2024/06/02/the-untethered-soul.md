## Review
A short and rewarding read. The Untethered Soul is a book about the good life. What it is. How to get it. 

The general contours read similar to many eastern text (eg. the Tao Te Ching) but laid out in a more approachable manner. Our suffering is rooted not in the things that happen to us but how we interpret and hold on to said things. The path to enlightenment is being aware. And then letting go. 

Would recommend. 

## Takeaways
- let go
- be aware when your energy changes and relax through it
- the path to freedom begins with deciding you don't want to suffer anymore
