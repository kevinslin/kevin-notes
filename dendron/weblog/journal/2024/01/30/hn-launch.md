- launch is hit or miss
- never ask people to upvote your article directly, algorithm will penalize you
- sometimes people post a screenshot of the title and ask people to go to yc homepage and manually find it (and even this is mixed results)
- hn has a soft spot for python and spreadsheets - since you have a product, its probably best for it to be a SHOW HN post
- good to leave a first comment that goes into details about engineering challengs and technical details
- there will be haters if your launch is successful, ignore them but try to have a civil response - its not for them but for everyone else
