- its a popularity contest. essentially when you launch, you want to get everyone that has ever used your product to upvote. generally, ask people to leave feedback on the ph page
- ph has a very lopsided outcome distribution - either you make the top 5 in your day or your never seen from again
- if you launch at the beginning of the week you have better chances of being top pick of the week which gives you another bump
- ph crowd likes having special treatment  - eg. discount codes or other things for ph people
