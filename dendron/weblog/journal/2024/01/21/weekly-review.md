## Storyworthy 

Recently finished **Storyworthy** by Mathew Dicks, best known for his record 58-time Moth StorySLAM wins. 
Dicks talks about the elements of a good story. 
My biggest takeaway: the 5s moment - all stories build up to an inflection point where the hero has a realization that changes their outlook of the world. Everything in the story should serve the purpose of building up to this moment. 
This is not dissimilar to product market fit (PMF) in the startup world. Your only real job as a startup founder is finding PMF. Anything that is not in service of this does not matter in an early stage startup.
