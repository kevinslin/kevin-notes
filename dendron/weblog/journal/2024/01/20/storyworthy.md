## Review

[Storyworthy](https://amzn.to/3vPMure) is a book about telling good stories. 

It is written by Mathew Dicks, an elementary school teacher and record 58-time Moth StorySLAM winner. 
The book is divided into three parts: finding your story, crafting it, and then telling it. 
Dick sprinkles some of his own stories in between technical chapters to showcase theory being put into practice. 
Storyworthy reads like the stories that Dick tells - heartfelt and personal with immensely useful takeaways. 

> Iâ€™ve always said that a good storytelling show feels like a cross between therapy, rehab, and hanging out after dinner with friends.

- crafting a story
	- 5 second moment: all stories build up to a 5s moment where the protagonist has a fundamental shift in their world view
	- beginning of story should have forward momentum

- telling
