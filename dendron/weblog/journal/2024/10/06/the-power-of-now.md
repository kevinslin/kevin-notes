## Notes
A helpful reminder when things seem too serious

> Accept â€” then act. **Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it**. Make it your friend and ally, not your enemy. This will miraculously transform your whole life.

- stop creating new pain, let go of old pain
- accept what is
- root yourself in your body
- surrender totally to the present
