I get asked a lot about YC and how to prepare for the application. The feedback I've most commonly given, listed below:

## On the Application
- go through the official [yc notes](https://www.ycombinator.com/howtoapply) on the topic - its succinct and actually does list out exactly what the partners are looking for in a YC founder
- YC cares less about the idea and more about the people - the understanding is that seed stage startups have a high failure rate and that no one, including YC, really knows which idea is going to make it. But what they've observed is that a good team, that is willing to iterate and "make something that people want", has the greatest chance of success and these are also the sorts of teams that YC funds
- If you know an existing YC founder, ask them to recommend you. YC has an internal referral program and it is something that partners take into consideration when looking at applicants
- If at first you don't succeed, try again. A large percentage of YC companies made it in after several attempts (including yours truly - I applied 3 times). Multiple attempts is not a bad thing and shows that doing a startup is more than just a passing fancy

## On the Interview
- Prepare a list of the three most important points you want to make to the partners with and try to get to them as soon as possible. The interview is only a few minutes and its easy to get side tracked
- Make sure you understand your problem space. Don't try to bs answers and admit if you don't know something
- If you can, practice the interview format with a friend or someone that has gone through the process before
