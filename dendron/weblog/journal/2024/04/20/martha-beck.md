Martha Beck is an author, life coach, and sociologist. She is best known for her 2005 book, "Leaving the Saints: How I Lost the Mormons and Found My Faith", a memoir about her upbringing within the Mormon faith and repressed memories of sexual abuse. 

My takeaways from [Martha Beck's Tim Ferris Interview](https://overcast.fm/+KebstaxP8):

- you're never lost, sometimes, you're just on the path of not here (this was in reference to tracking a wild porcupine in south africa - you are never lost but rather getting information that the current place and direction isn't the way you want to end up)
- you can't be creative and anxious at the same time
- reconnecting with feelings by bringing to mind things that bring joy through the five sense (eg. 3 things that you love to taste, 3 things that you love to hear, etc)
