used [levels](https://www.levelshealth.com/) when they were in preview - was super helpful. 
stopped using after two months because I found that I more or less knew what it was going to tell me.

some things that I took away:
- I have a high blood glucose baseline during the day (~105)
- exercise before eating didn't help with glucose levels after eating but taking a walk 5 min after eating did
- eating rice totally killed my glucose - ended up switching to quina instead
- certain fruits like apples spike up my glucose more than others
- keto icecream does not affect glucose but also tastes like cardboard
