Some thoughts about flying regularly from Seattle (SEA) to San Francisco (SFO):

### airlines
- air alaska has most frequent flights between two locations at a fair price
- can be helpful to pay for travel lounge (~$500) as there are lounge locations in both SEA and SFO
- air alaska card can be helpful (priority boarding, 3x points) though you technically get better deal in terms of pure dollars with chase freedom (5x when booking through chase travel)

### to seattle
- taking light rail to city and uber from there if necessary. light rail gives you room to work on laptop if you take side seats

### to san francisco
- uber to most places in the city is quick (<20min), cost ~$30

## trip
- flight to sf faster, 1h45
- flight to seattle longer, 2h plus
