### 1. Anu Atluru oon Pursuits That Can’t Scale
- source: [Pursuits That Can’t Scale](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/pursuits-that-cant-scale)

Atluru opens with the common startup refrain - "do things that don't scale" and spells out the unspoke corollary to that statement: "in order to do things that do scale". The end goal is scale. Its to build a massively successful business that creates huge impact as well as financial gain.

Atluru contrasts this with doing **things that can't scale**. These are human scale pursuits that are limited by physical limitations and lists physical sports as examples.

Finally, Atluru makes the connection that those that pursue the former tend to shift to the latter after achieving scale or trying for a long time. That the latter is an antitode when founders suffer of burnout of the former.

I think there's truth here. Being grounded in "human scale pursuits" helps anchor us to life. The simplicity of doing a craft and slowly getting better has both an immediate and long term payoff.
