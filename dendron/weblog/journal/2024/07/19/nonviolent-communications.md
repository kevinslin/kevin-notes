## Review

TBD

## Notes

### 1. Giving from the heart
- 4 components:
    - observations
    - feelings
    - needs 
    - request

### 2. Communication That Blocks Compassion
- when we analyze shortcomings of others, we are expressing our needs (eg. they are aloof -> we want connecting)
- when we don't take responsibility for our actions, we don't acknowledge our choice (eg. i have to do X vs i'm doing X because I want Y)
- when we communicate desires as demands, this does not allow compassion

### 3. Observing Without Evaluating
- **do not mix observations and evaluations**, otherwise people will hear criticism
- distinguish feelings and thought (eg. i feel that you should know better vs when you did X, i felt surprised because i wanted to rely on you)

### 4. Identifying and Expressing Feelings
- #star

- express vulnerability when communicating

- distinguish your **feelings from thoughts**
    - you are using thoughts when you say "feel" followed by:
        - words such as `that`, `like`, `if`
            - eg: 
                - "I feel that you are not listening to me"
                - "I feel like this is not getting through to you"
        - pronouns like `I`, `you`, etc
            - eg:
                - "I feel you are not listening"
                - "I feel I'm barelying keeping it together"
        - names or nouns of people

- distinguish **feelings from statements**
    1. Description of what we think we are: "I feel inadequate as a guitar player."
    2. Expressions of actual feelings: "I feel disappointed in myself as a guitar player."
    
- distinguish btw feelings and **how we think others are reacting**
    - eg. "I feel unimportant/misunderstood/attacked" vs "I feel discouraged when you say I'm not trying because I have been putting two hours a day into getting better"
    - examples of statements:
        - abandoned
        - abused
        - attacked
        - misunderstood
        - patronized
        - provoked
        - taken for granted
        - unappreciated
        - unheard
        - unseen
        - unsupported
        - unwanted

### 5. Taking Responsibility for Our Feelings
- when we get netative feelings we can
    - blame ourselves
    - blame others
    - sense our own feelings
    - sense the others feelings

- diff between taking responsibility or attributing blame outside
    - violent: “You disappointed me by not coming over last evening.” 
    - nvc: “I was disappointed when you didn’t come over, because I wanted to talk over some things that were bothering me.”

- speech patterns to mask responsibility
    1. Use of impersonal pronouns such as it and that:
        - eg:  "It makes me so mad when we talk about the same things and get nowhere"
    2. The use of the expression "I feel (an emotion) because .. " followed by a person or personal pronoun other than I:
        - eg: "I feel hurt because you are not listening to me"
    3. Statements that mention only the actions of others:
        - eg: "When you react strongly to me talking about my feelings, I feel sad"
    
- speech patterns that take responsibility -> `I feel... because I need`
    - eg: "I feel despair when we talk over one another because I want us to both feel listened to (even if it doesn't result in agreement) vs blocking each other out"
    - eg: "I feel sad when we can't talk about money because I want everyone to be taken care of"
    
- masking resposnsibility = invoke guilt, expressing need or hurt is giving from the heart

### 6. Requesting That Which Would Enrich Life
- make concrete requests

## Examples

### Practicing giving from the heart
> this shows trying to listen with empahty without explaining or defending

* MBR: Are you angry because you would like my government to use its resources differently? (I didn’t know whether my guess was correct—what was critical was my sincere effort to connect with his feeling and need.) 
* Man: Damn right I’m angry! You think we need tear gas? We need sewers, not your tear gas! We need housing! We need to have our own country! 
* MBR: So you’re furious and would appreciate some support in improving your living conditions and gaining political independence? 
* Man: Do you know what it’s like to live here for twenty-seven years the way I have with my family—children and all? Have you got the faintest idea what that’s been like for us? 
* MBR: Sounds like you’re feeling very desperate and you’re wondering whether I or anybody else can really understand what it’s like to be living under these conditions. Am I hearing you right? 
* Man: You want to understand? Tell me, do you have children? Do they go to school? Do they have playgrounds? My son is sick! He plays in open sewage! His classroom has no books! Have you seen a school that has no books?

### Observing without giving criticism

* MBR: (guessing at the observations being made) Are you reacting to my having taken thirty straight minutes to present my views before giving you a chance to talk?
* Phil: No, you make it sound so simple.
* MBR: (trying to obtain further clarification) Are you reacting to my not having said anything about how the process can be difficult for some people to apply?
* Phil: No, not some people--you!
* MBR: So you're reacting to my not having said that the process can be difficult for me at times?
* Phil: That's right.
* MBR: Are you feeling annoyed because you would have liked some sign from me that indicated that I have some problems with the process myself?
* Phil: (after a moment's pause) That's right.
* MBR: (feeling more relaxed now that I am in touch
* with the person's feeling and need, I direct my
* attention to what he might be requesting of me)
* Would you like me to admit right now that
* this process can be a struggle for me to apply?
