My top three takeaways from Tim Ferris's recent interview with Claire Hughes Johnson (former COO of stripe):

1. Say the thing you think you cannot say: its not just when the emperor has no clothes but when a group of people have underlying conflicts that never got made explicit. Claire shares an example from stripe where two teams worked on the same feature set with no one speaking out.
2. Pushers and Pullers, a mental model for top talent: pushers constantly ask for more but can be abrasive to work with. Pullers will take all the work you give them until they flame out and leave. A good manager understands these limits and helps people move past them. 
3. Renegotiation: just because you've committed to something doesn't mean that you can't change course when circumstances change. most applicable in terms of commitments of your time and responsibilities
