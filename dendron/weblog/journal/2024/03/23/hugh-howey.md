Hugh Howey is known for the Wool series and the most successful self published authors on Amazon. He also happens to be one of my favorite writes. 

Lots of tidbits from a close to [two hour long interview](https://overcast.fm/+KebtuT9SY) with Tim Ferris.

What stood out to me:

1. Howey's commitment to "10 years of obscurity" - this is going in without high expectations and a long term commitment to the work vs the outcome
2. Holding on to digital rights as a writer - will be tough for anyone that doesn't have leverage (aka success) to negotiate from publishers but if a series is successful, the world of digital adaptation and remixes can make the digital more valuable even to the print rights
3. Collaborative writing - writing is intensely personal and there are many (myself included) that have a hard time letting others in on the process. But the act of writing is often long, lonely, and grueling. Finding someone to partner in the journey that genuinely compliments your style is akin to finding a soul mate. Or an effective co-founder.  

Also appreciated the bountiful book recommendations. Two that I'm especially excited about: 
- [Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow](https://www.amazon.com/Tomorrow-novel-Gabrielle-Zevin/dp/0593321200/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20)
- [This Is How You Lose the Time War](https://www.amazon.com/This-How-You-Lose-Time/dp/1534430997/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20)
