Every once in a while, I do an "energy audit" - I go over a past number of weeks and months and parse out what people and activities have given me energy and vice versa.

For 2024 (thus far), my audit goes as follows.

Give energy:
- forward momentum at work
- being around good people 
- closing sales
- hard physical exercise
- focusing on 1-2 things at a time
- commit to big decisions
- writing
- self growth

Drain Energy:
- lack of momentum or active setbacks at work
- being around the wrong sorts of people 
- unqualified sales calls
- being injured 
- frequent context switching
- open loops on big decisions
- (over) consumption of media
- self regression

While some details (eg. momentum measured in size of community vs sales closed) changed over time, the themes of this list (do excellent work, be around good people, exercise, commit, focus, create things, improve) have been consistent for as long as I tracked this (~10 years now).
