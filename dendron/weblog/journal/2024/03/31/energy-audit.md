Every once in a while, I do an "energy audit" - I go over a past number of weeks and months and parse out what people and activities have given me energy and vice versa.

For 2024, I've come up with the following list.

Give energy:
- forward momentum at work
- being around good people 
- closing sales
- hard physical exercise
- focusing on 1-2 things at a time
- commit to big decisions
- writing

Drain Energy:
- lack of momentum or active setbacks at work
- being around the wrong sorts of people 
- unqualified sales calls
- being injured 
- frequent context switching
- open loops on big decisions
- unnecessary meetings
