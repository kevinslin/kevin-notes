There's some irony here as AWS, and the cloud in general, play a direct role in organizations not understanding the cost of their systems. The granular usage based nature of cloud services means that there is both unprecedented detail as well as unbelievable complexity to every unit of work. This has spawned an entire industry (#finops) precisely because the costs run so high and the understanding is so low.
