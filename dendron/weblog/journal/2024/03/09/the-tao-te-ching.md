## Review

The Tao Te Ching is a collection of 81 chapters of Chinese classical text that describe the essence of Taoism. Loosely translated as "the way", Taoism is a mix of philosophy and religion that has deep roots in Chinese culture. 

At the heart of the "Tao Te Ching" is the attempt to describe the indescribable Tao. The chapters are like  "fingers pointing at the moon; if you watch the finger, you canâ€™t see the moon."

The Tao is not hard. It is not hidden. It is not a secret. You find by letting go. You master by yielding. You act by not doing. 

The theme of letting go is common across most chapters. Of desires. Of labels. Of delusion. In this regard, the Tao Te Ching share an overlap with buddhist text that preach a similar path towards enlightenment.

Reading the chapters, you feel there is an understanding that starts to form, like a floater in your eye, just at the edge of your awareness but gone when you focus.
