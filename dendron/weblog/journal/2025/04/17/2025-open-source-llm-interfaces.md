If you're thinking about building interfaces for large language models (LLMs)‚Äîwhether through sleek apps or quick command-line tools‚Äîyou're in luck. There's a growing collection of open-source frameworks that help you spin up these tools fast, in Python or TypeScript, and they'll happily connect with your favorite cloud APIs or local LLM setups. Let's dive into what's out there, keeping it practical, brief, and focused on getting you started quickly.

### UI Toolkits: Quick Front-Ends for Your Models

- **Chainlit (Python)**: Imagine a ChatGPT-style app that you can deploy in a few minutes‚ÄîChainlit makes it straightforward. It plays nicely with any Python-based LLM setup, whether that's LangChain, OpenAI's API, or a local model running on your laptop.

- **Gradio (Python)**: Perfect for rapidly prototyping web interfaces. Gradio's chat components are easy to set up, and it integrates seamlessly with both local and cloud-based models. Ideal for sharing quick demos or internal tools.

- **Streamlit (Python)**: If you're looking to prototype quickly, Streamlit is your friend. Its new chat UI components make spinning up interactive notebooks or chatbots a breeze, compatible with virtually any LLM backend.

- **assistant-ui (TypeScript/React)**: This one's for you React fans‚Äîassistant-ui provides elegant, customizable chat interface components. It's designed to work out-of-the-box with major providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and even local setups like Ollama or Mistral.

### Drag-and-Drop Visual Builders

- **LangFlow (Python + React)**: Drag, drop, and connect LangChain components visually. Quickly prototype complex workflows without deep coding. Export your setup straight to Python when you're ready to go deeper.

- **Flowise (TypeScript/Node)**: Similar to LangFlow but built around LangChainJS. Great for rapid assembly of chatbots or agents, complete with deployable templates, Docker setups, and embedded chat widgets.

### Command-Line Tools for Quick Scripting

- **llm CLI (Python)**: Simon Willison's fantastic little CLI tool can talk to just about any LLM‚Äîlocal or cloud‚Äîusing plugins. It‚Äôs like a Swiss Army knife for prompt engineering directly from your terminal.

- **ShellGPT (Python)**: A minimalist wrapper around the OpenAI API, ShellGPT lets you execute quick LLM queries straight from your shell, and it can even generate shell commands you can run immediately.

### Batteries-Included Chat Applications

- **Hugging Face Chat UI (SvelteKit)**: The backend-agnostic HuggingChat UI supports OpenAI, Anthropic, local llama.cpp servers, and more. Rich features include tool calls, multimodal inputs, web search integration, and user authentication.

- **Chatbot UI (Next.js)**: Mckay Wrigley's popular ChatGPT-like interface, easy to self-host, with support for multiple backends (primarily OpenAI and Azure, but extendable).

- **Text Generation Web UI (Python)**: Affectionately known as Oobabooga, this UI specializes in running local models effortlessly. Includes built-in model downloaders, chat presets, and active community plugins.

- **GPT4All (Desktop App, Python/TypeScript bindings)**: For private, offline LLM usage, GPT4All supports thousands of local models through a friendly desktop app, ideal for keeping your data local.

- **Open Assistant (Python/TypeScript)**: A full-stack, open-source alternative to ChatGPT complete with plugin support and rich tooling, suitable for robust, production-like setups.
