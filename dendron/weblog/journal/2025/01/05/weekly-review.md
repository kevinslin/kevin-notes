## Takeaways

### [Tim ferris interview with Becky Kennedy](https://overcast.fm/+AAKebv5QngU)

Kennedy is a rockstar for a new generation of parents seeking to raise resillient kids with secure attachment styles. Many nuggets in this interview - my main takeaways have nothing to do with parenting:
- setting boundaries defines what you are willing to tolerate and have control over. if your kid is doing something that is disruptive, don't just tell them to stop. tell them you're going to stop them if they don't stop. 
- guilt can be useful to understand when your actions have gone out of line with your values. taking on other people's feelings is not guilt. that's taking responsibility for something that is not yours to take (eg. your mother wanting to come see the kids and you not having time and telling her no. your mom can be upset and  you can emphasize with her. but you don't need to take on her sadness). this is where boundaries are useful. visualize other peoples emotions as a physical thing and push them so that they don't come over to your side of the field. no one benefits when you take responsibility for other people's emotion

### [Huberman podcast - Optimize Your Learning & Creativity With Science-Based Tools](https://overcast.fm/+AA2-B8W8Y04)

Huberman is a treasure trove of helpful insights. My notes:
- delay coffee by 2h after waking to let body naturally wake up
- hydrate first thing in morning and again at 4pm
- adenosine makes us sleepy. its a neuromodulator that modulates effects of neurotransmitters - for humans, it affects sleep. coffee si adenosine antagonist (binds to adenosine without activating it). it builds up during the day and is cleared at night.
- cortisol makes us awake. peaks in morning. also activated by stress
- do intense work in morning, creative work in afternoon, easy work at night
- important to get light in morning **and** evening to signal wake up and sleep

### [I am rich and have no idea what to do](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42579873)

despite not having a mega exit, i found myself resonating with a lot of the points - mainly the loss of identity/purpose and having a hard time finding something new to pick up. in my case, it was more with burnout vs having no more base desires due to infinite money. this led to a similar journey of doing a bunch of ridiculous things in order to "feel" again. everything seemed to pale in comparison to the all consuming call of being a founder. 

Some takeaways after scanning hundreds of HN comments:
- collect hobbies
- be useful
- write high quality code that you want to write
- focus on living your values
