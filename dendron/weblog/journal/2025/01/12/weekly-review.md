### Essentialism with Greg McKeown
- [source](https://overcast.fm/+AAKebvKh6nE)

Self help has been my most read genre. A lot of the advice overlaps but sometimes you just need to hear it from many perspectives before it sticks. 

Notes from the episode:
- technique for dissecting a problem: what, so what, now what
    > found this helpful to chain into a therapy session with carl rogers as described below
- therapy sessions by recording your current problem and feeding it into chatgpt and prompting it to respond as carl rogers would, using empathetic listening
    > promt that was successful for me: **analyze the following session transcript and respond as carl rogers would ...**
- essence of essentialism: explore (what is essential), eliminate (what is not essential), execute (make it effortless to do what is essential)
- quarterly offsite: what are essential things i’m under investing in, what are non essential things i’m over investing in, how do i bridge this?
- planning for the day: 1 essential task,2 minotr tasks, 3 maintenance tasks
- what is essential to Tim: mastering something or making something
    > relate to this and would also add - deepening relationship with someone
- its "easy" to look back at tough event and later realize that you're grateful for it because of what it taught you - its much harder to do this about a current tough event - a training technique is to say "I'm grateful for {current hardship} because..." and let your mind linger on the question
    > this is similar to poet David Whyte's approach of [beautiful questions](https://lifecurator.co/life/all-the-beautiful-questions-that-david-whyte-asked-me) - the mind will work to fill in the gaps
- reframe current events as "its happening ~~to~~ for me"
    > like the aforementioned gratefulness exercise, this forces your mind to fill in the difference
