## Notes
Julian Jaynes was an American psychologist best known for histheory of the bicameral mind which he explains in this book. 

His thesis is that human consciousness, as we know it today (introspection and awareness), did not exist in early humans due to environmental changes and development of linguistic faculties. 

He cites evidence from early literature which did not have words for thinking or introspection. Instead, fables like the Odyssey carry out acts by hearing the voice of god (eg. Apollo tells hector when to attack). In early bible books like Genesis, the people are guided by the external voice of god. 

Jaynes argues that early humans did not possess self awareness but rather were beset by auditory hallucinations which they interpreted as the voice of god, and that the remnants of this process is what is seen in schizophrenic patients

Perhaps if he were around today, he'd argue that modern humans have also lost their conciousness and now follow the voice of the algorithm?
