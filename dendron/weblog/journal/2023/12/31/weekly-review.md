### [#7 - The Hippie With A Billion Dollars — My First Million — Overcast](https://overcast.fm/+rTsXY1BqA)

My takeaway from my first million episode with Michael Birch  (best known for selling Bebo to AOL for $850M): stick to what works: michael spent his entire career building viral social applications, sometimes copying 80% of the code of a prior project to launch a new business. this is in stark contrast to the state of front end development where there is a new frameworks and shiny technology every month.

### [Jason Fried challenges your thinking on fundraising, goals, growth, and more — Lenny's Podcast: Product | Growth | Career — Overcast](https://overcast.fm/+6K1HaZVAE)

Jason Fried is the founder of 37 signals, a private web design company best known for basecamp and creating the ruby on rails framework.
Jason has made a name for himself in the valley as a champion of bootstrapping and arguing that most businesses do not need or are even helped by VC funding.

My takeaway from his recent episode on Lenny's Podcast: aim for simplicity.

"Simple can also be hard, but complicated is a lot harder."

Companies become complicated when they grow too big or are doing too many things which results in enormous amounts of energy being directed at keeping the lights on.

Startups, in the beginning, can be simple. This is their biggest point of leverage against incumbents.

### [99 Years of Charlie Munger Wisdom in 44 Minutes — My First Million — Overcast](https://overcast.fm/+rTsXKt_rU)

A lot has been said about Charlie Munger since his passing. While I never met the man, his principle maxim, "always invert", has been a big influence on how I approach open ended problems.

The gist goes as follows: when faced with an ambiguous problem like living a good life or building a successful business, look at what it takes to accomplish the opposite and avoid doing those things. The logic is that it is far easier to find figure out what not to do then try to identify all the things that one might need to do. 

You can see a great example of this in Munger's Harvard commencement speech on how to be miserable

### [#713: Matt Mullenweg — The Art of Crafting a Sabbatical, Tips for Defending Against Hackers, Leveraging Open Source, Thriving in an AI World, and Tips for Life’s Darkest Hours — The Tim Ferriss Show — Overcast](https://overcast.fm/+KebsB8SGU)

Matt highlights Automatic's sabbatical policy - a fantastic policy that more companies should adopt. 
After college, few careers offer real breaks, leading to burnout and loss of talent. 

I experienced this firsthand last year. I was burned out after running a startup for three years and had the entire company take a month sabbatical. This definitely felt conterintuitive as our company was goining thorugh a pivot. But a dull blade cuts little and we all needed a break. 

We ended up shutting down the old business and going in a completely new direction. It worked out and we now make more in a month than we did in a year. 


<!-- It felt extravagent when - not having a clear business AND taking time off but it was absolutely the right thing.  -->
