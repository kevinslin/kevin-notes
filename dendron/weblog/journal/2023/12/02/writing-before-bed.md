Everyday I tell myself this story that I'm going to do some writing before bedtime.

When bedtime comes around, I am playing a game. I'm reading manga. I'm on hacker news.
I'm staring at the wall. Anything and everything else except putting words inside a notebook. 

I leave things for future me. He won't procrastinate. Feel unmotivated. Encounter resistance.
