### [711: Andrew Rosener — The Path from Scallop Kingpin to Selling 8-Figure Domains, Achieving Financial Freedom, and How to Live a Contrarian Life — The Tim Ferriss Show — Overcast](https://overcast.fm/+Kebt-tbsQ)

Andrew Rosener is the king of domain brokerage and has closed over $500 million in domain deals in the last two decades. He talks about his random walk towards the domain business and dives into the nitty gritty of the domain brokerage business. 

This interview was the first to make me understand why six to eight figure fitures are paid out regularly for premium domains, especially as tld's themselves seem to be a dime a dozen. Rosener explains a domain's value as its abiltiy to drive organize search and convert and his formula of working backwards to a domain's objective value based on paid search prices of the given industry. 

He is also the first person I've heard to invest in a company by lending the company a premium domain for a mixture of cash and equity. The business seems crazy good on paper - if the company succeeds, that's valuable equity. If it fails, there's still a cash component and the ability to clawback the domain name.
