I started [blogging in 2013](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/806c4d93-da28-4002-b454-b183c37441f6/). 
This was after a 3 month backpacking trip after college. 

Since then, me and blogging have been like Ross and Rachel, a constant off again and on again kind of affair.

Its 2023 and we're on again. Things are a little different this time - I'm coming at this with the mindset of a workspace for things in progress vs a destination for polished work. So less **blog**, more **log**. 

So here's to log uno of 2023.
