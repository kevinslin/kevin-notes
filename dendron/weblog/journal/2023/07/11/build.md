## Review

Tony Fadell, inventor of the nest, talks about his framework to building exceptional products. He divides it into four parts: starting from the self and ones career and ending at the product and the team. 

Fadell believes in having a north star, both when designing a life and a product. The particular destination isn't as important as having a higher calling to strive for and surrounding yourself with exceptional people that can get there. 

He places an emphasis on story telling, decision making, and deeply understanding the customer journey.  Every feature of a product should have a narrative that explains the "why".  While the team should stay flexible during the design and rollout of a product, there should be 1-2 things core to the product that endures. 

Its a good book with lots of actionable advice.
