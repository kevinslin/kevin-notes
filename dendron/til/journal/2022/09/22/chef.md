## Summary
- source: {{fm.url}}

## Notes
- chef one of few companies in enterprise that is fully open source
- many companies now go with BSL license or open core model where lots of features aren't open source
- chef did not have a happy ending, acquired by private equity for much lower than what it should have received based on what it was making

- statement from chef and also other folks in the space: go open source if community can be your biggest asset
  - caveat: maybe not open source everything though - no business competition
