## Goals
- x fix dendron 
- [w] aws reference
- x reach out to 3 people


## Notes

Spend most of the day figuring out the issue with the binaries. 
Instead of trying to push forward, ended up reverting back to the universal build without bundled sqlite to resolve immediate pain and to give myself more time to test the platform specific build at a later date
